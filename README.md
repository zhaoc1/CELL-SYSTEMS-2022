# CELL-SYSTEMS-2022

This is the repository for the paper "Pitfalls of genotyping microbial communities with rapidly growing genome collections". All the figures can be reproduced.

```
git clone https://github.com/zhaoc1/CELL-SYSTEMS-2022.git
cd CELL-SYSTEMS-2022
unzip Rdata.zip
```

Then the `figures.pdf` report can be generated by knitting the `figures.Rmd` in Rstudio.

We also archived a earlier version of [midas2](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2) (iggtools v0.5) here.

The cross mapping experiment design is included in the `cross_mapping_experiment`, which includes simulating reads, read mapping and metagenotyping, and benchmark the precison and recall.
